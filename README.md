# py_dof
Calculate Dynamic Orbital Forces with Python

Installing is very simple but several dependencies to PySCF, gbasis and IOData exist.
- https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf
- https://github.com/theochem/gbasis
- https://github.com/theochem/iodata

If possible, install those three in a conda environment and then install py_dof with:

python setup.py install
